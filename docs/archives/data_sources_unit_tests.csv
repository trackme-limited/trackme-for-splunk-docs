Order,Item,LastTested,Type,Instructions
1,Refresh,,UI,"Hit Refresh btn in data sources screen, all Splunk searches should be refreshed as well as other objects such as the HTML based header and its values"
2,Acknowledge active alert,,UI,"On a data source currently in a non green state, hit Acknowledge btn, choose a period optionally and confirm, the action should be successful and the state icon updated, an active Ack record is stored in the lookup trackme_alerts_ack"
3,Disable Acknowledgement,,UI,"On a data source currently in a non green state, and for which an Ack was enabled, click on the Ack btn again, in the Ack screen click on the raw table and confirm, the record should be disabled (but remains in the lookup trackme_alerts_ack) and the icon back to a normal state"
4,Enable monitoring,,UI,"Hit disable btn, the fields data_monitored_state in the lookup trackme_data_source_monitoring needs to get defined with a string value equal to disabled"
5,Disable monitoring,,UI,"Hit disable btn, the fields data_monitored_state in the lookup trackme_data_source_monitoring needs to get defined with a string value equal to disabled"
6,Delete temporary,,UI,"Hit delete btn, in the next screen choose temporary deletion, the entity should disappear from the UI and removed from the  lookup trackme_data_source_monitoring. Finally, run the short term tracker, the entity should be re-created with its defaut values and re-appear in the UI"
7,Delete permanently,,UI,"Hit delete btn, in the next screen choose permanent deletion, the entity should disappear from the UI and removed from the  lookup trackme_data_source_monitoring. In addition, the audit record in the lookup trackme_audit_changes contains a change_type record equal to delete permanent, this is being used to avoid adding the entity again upon discovery. Finally, run the short term tracker, the entity should be NOT re-created nor made visible in the UI"
8,Priority update,,UI,"Change priority using the priority drilldown, the relevant value (low/medium/high) will be defined in the lookup trackme_data_source_monitoring in the priority field"
9,Search,,UI,"Hit the Search btn, a new Splunk search tab opens in the Web Browser, the search is automatically populated according to the entity for regular data sources, for Elastic Sources, the search constraint gets rebuild from the lookups trackme_elastic_sources/trackme_elastic_sources_dedicated depending on the type of object"
10,Modify lagging value in forced mode,,UI,"Hit the Modify btn, choose a different value in seconds for the lagging and set the override dropdown to true then hit the apply btn, the UI should refresh with the new lagging value and this value needs to override any lagging class that could be matching the same entitiy context"
11,Reverse lagging value forced,,UI,"In the same screen, set the override dropdown to false and hit the apply btn, run the trackers, the previously defined value remains (unless a lagging class matches the entitiy context)"
12,Create a new lagging class,,UI,"Create a new lagging class which matches the entity context previously handled in 10/11, apply the policy and run the trackers, a new value should be defined for max lagging of this entity"
13,Change the Alert over KPIs,,UI,"Switch the KPIs dropdown sequentially to the 2 non default states, verify that the field data_lag_alert_kpis in the lookup trackme_data_source_monitoring is updated and preserved over tracker iterations"
14,Change Week days monitoring (preset rules),,UI,"Switch the week days dropdown to a different pre-set value, this change gets reflected in the data_monitoring_wdays field in the lookup trackme_data_source, run the trakers and make sure this is preserved over tracker iteration. For further advanced feature testing, testing the behaviour on a target data source and apply the different options to verify that the rule is being applied accordingly"
15,Change Week days monitoring (custom rules),,UI,"Switch the week days dropdown to a manual rule, this change gets reflected in the data_monitoring_wdays field in the lookup trackme_data_source under the form of ** manual: 1,2, 3** depending on the week days selected , run the trakers and make sure this is preserved over tracker iteration. For further advanced feature testing, testing the behaviour on a target data source and apply the different options to verify that the rule is being applied accordingly"
16,Change monitoring level,,UI,"Select the index level monitoring level, the field changed in the lookup trackme_data_source is called data_monitoring_level, run the tracker and make sure it is preserved over trackers iterations. For further behaviour tests, a data source in alert (not meeting monitoring condition) will not turn red if it set to index level AND if at least one other monitored sourcetypes meets monitoring conditions"
17,Change Hosts Distinct Count,,UI,"Modify the Hosts dcount text input (default to string any) to a positive numerical value, the field changed in the lookup trackme_data_source is called min_dcount_host and needs to be preserved over tracker iterations. Additionally, once set this value is compared with the actual value stored in dcount_host, the data source needs to turn red if this value goes beyond the threshold that was defined. When the entity is in red mode, the status message should show a special information unless another condition took precedence."
